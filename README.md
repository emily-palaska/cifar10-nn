# cifar10-nn
This report is created as part of the Neural Networks \&amp; Deep Learning course in Electrical and Computer Engineering department of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.
For this course, we are aiming to implement a Neural Network from scratch, meaning with minimal use of ready methods from libraries, to solve a classification problem.
To achieve this, the CIFAR-10 dataset, originally introduced by Alex Krizhevsky, was utilized.

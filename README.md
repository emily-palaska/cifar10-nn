# cifar10-nn
Neural Networks are increasingly being employed for many real-world problems, including image classification. For this course, we investigate the implementation and evaluation of neural networks for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. By combining custom implementations from scratch with ready-made architectures, the study aims to understand the inner workings of neural networks while leveraging advanced, optimized models for benchmarking.
